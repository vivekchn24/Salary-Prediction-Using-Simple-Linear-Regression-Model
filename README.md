  ## **📎 This project does not include business insights. It is intended for practice only.**

## **⚠️ Important:-**

- The code, analysis, and outputs in this project are not to be copied and used elsewhere, including in resumes or other projects that's why i attached jupyter notebook pdf only.The goal of this project is to practice and improve my skills, not to provide ready-to-use solutions.

-->Feel free to refer to the attached Jupyter notebook PDF for practice and understanding the concepts. This project is meant to showcase my personal learning journey through Machine-Learning-Model-Building , and you can use it as a reference to practice and enhance your skills in Machine-Learning.

## **📌 Disclaimer:**

-This Machine-Learning-Model-Building project is created purely for learning and practice purposes; hence, I’ve shared only the PDF versions of the Jupyter Notebook and PowerPoint to maintain originality and avoid direct copy-paste.
